The IDGAF License v1.1
=======================================================================
Copyright (C) 2014 CS`

THE AUTHOR OF THIS LICENSE DECLARES HIS/HER INCOMPETENCE 
AS A LAWYER AND STATES THAT ANY USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF
THIS LICENSE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED LEGALLY UNINFORMED.

========================================================

1. Definitions
--------------

 a. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities 
    that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

 b. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original 
    and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale 
    or other transfer of ownership.
 
 c. "Original author" means the individual, individuals, entity or 
    entities that originally created the Work.

 d. "Work" means the stuff that you didn't make, was created by the 
    Original author(s) and you don't own. Includes anything distributed 
    as part of the package, be it software, written works or digital 
    media. Movies and music. That kind of stuff.

2. License grant
----------------

You (the Licensor) can do whatever the fuck you want. The Author 
simply doesn't care about what you do with it. 
Ever wonder what IDGAF stands for, anyways? Well, wonder no more:

 * I
 * Don't
 * Give
 * A
 * Fuck

Basically, as long as you mention the Original author and
send a beer/cookie his/her way, we'll all be fine. 

3. Restrictions
---------------

You're not allowed to bitch about the Work. Not ever.
Don't whine about how bad the memory leaks are or how the storyline 
sucks. If you don't like it, change it or stop using it.

Face it. Noone gives a fuck. Do better or shut the fuck up.

You're free to compliment the Original author on his choice of 
wardrobe, though. Also, it helps to compliment the Author on his/her 
good hair day and perfect abs.

Donations are also an acceptable forms of praise.

4. Liability
------------

The Author disclaims any liability regarding the 
use of the work provided.

Seriously, none. No claims are made regarding the 
usefulness or safety of the Work.

5. Termination
--------------

The License and the rights granted will terminate automatically upon 
any breach by the Licensor. This includes bitching, whining and 
tormenting the Author with inane questions already answered elsewhere.

6. Miscellaneous
----------------

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, 
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same 
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

In layman's terms: give it like you got it.
